# Encryption and decryption using classical techniques
Hello everyone , I am pursuing minor in cse at iitb and have cryptography as my first subject so i wanted to create a encoding/decoding mechanism.
Basically the code works in simple steps:
1)it asks if you would want to encode or decode the plaintext,
2)it would ask for the type of technique you would want: shift , vegenere or substitution.
3)it would ask for the key depending on the type you choose.
4)it would give the output.
